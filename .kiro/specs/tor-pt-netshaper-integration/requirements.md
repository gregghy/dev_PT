# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates NetShaper traffic obfuscation into the existing Tor Pluggable Transport (PT) that uses QUIC tunneling. The goal is to add a layer of traffic shaping and obfuscation to make the QUIC tunnel traffic less detectable by network analysis tools, while maintaining the simplest possible integration approach.

The current PT system consists of a bridge (server) and client that establish QUIC connections for tunneling Tor traffic. The NetShaper integration will wrap the QUIC traffic with obfuscation patterns to disguise its characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Tor user, I want my PT QUIC traffic to be obfuscated using NetShaper, so that network monitoring cannot easily identify or block my Tor connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PT bridge starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a NetShaper peer2 (server) wrapper to obfuscate outgoing traffic
2. WHEN the PT client starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a NetShaper peer1 (client) wrapper to obfuscate outgoing traffic  
3. WHEN QUIC traffic flows between client and bridge THEN NetShaper SHALL apply traffic shaping patterns to disguise the traffic characteristics
4. WHEN NetShaper processes are running THEN the PT SHALL continue to function normally with transparent obfuscation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the NetShaper integration to use sensible default configurations, so that I don't need to manually configure complex obfuscation parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PT starts THEN the system SHALL use predefined NetShaper configuration profiles optimized for Tor traffic
2. WHEN no custom NetShaper configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL fall back to default obfuscation settings
3. WHEN NetShaper configuration files are needed THEN the system SHALL generate them automatically from templates
4. IF NetShaper binaries are not found THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with installation guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the NetShaper integration to be minimally invasive to the existing PT code, so that maintenance and updates remain simple.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating NetShaper THEN the existing QUIC connection logic SHALL remain largely unchanged
2. WHEN NetShaper is enabled THEN traffic SHALL be routed through NetShaper processes transparently
3. WHEN NetShaper fails to start THEN the PT SHALL either fall back to direct QUIC or fail gracefully with clear error messages
4. WHEN the PT shuts down THEN all NetShaper processes SHALL be properly terminated and cleaned up

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Tor user, I want the obfuscated PT to maintain good performance characteristics, so that my browsing experience is not significantly degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NetShaper is processing traffic THEN the additional latency SHALL be minimized through efficient process communication
2. WHEN high traffic volumes occur THEN NetShaper SHALL not become a bottleneck for the QUIC tunnel
3. WHEN NetShaper processes crash THEN the system SHALL detect failures and attempt recovery or graceful degradation
4. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track NetShaper performance metrics and resource usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to be able to configure and control the NetShaper obfuscation, so that I can adapt to different network environments and threat models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the PT THEN the system SHALL accept configuration parameters for NetShaper behavior
2. WHEN different obfuscation profiles are needed THEN the system SHALL support switching between predefined configurations
3. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL provide logging output from both PT and NetShaper components
4. WHEN NetShaper configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime reconfiguration without full restart
